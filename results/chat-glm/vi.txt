Hartley's pronouns are vi/vir/vis/virs/virself, and since Hartley is a writer, the appropriate pronoun to use in this context would be "writes." However, since you're asking for a one-word answer, the word "writes" is too long. If we had to condense it to a single word, we could use "writes" as it is, but if we're strictly looking for a single word, it would be challenging to find a suitable one that fits the context. If we had to choose, "writes" would be the closest, despite it being two words.
